# 2019-Phase-1

Phase 1 of MSA in 2019 will have 2 components: 

- Submitting one of the mini projects that the Microsoft Student Partners (MSPâ€™s) will outline in the videos they create
    - AI and Machine learning
    - Big Data and Analytics
    - Cognitive services
    - Databases/API
    - Serverless programming
    - Web App
- Watch three videos on the [Microsoft learn platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) and submit a screenshot of the dashboard
    - The MSP's will outline which three videos you have to watch in the respective YouTube video.

It is in your best interest to watch as many videos and upskill as much as you can on all the content create by the MSP's as Phase 2 will incorporate components of each video to create a more complete software system.

These videos will be uploaded to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCegNuS_AZjK-P3ZMN3JXNw) channel - Subscribe and turn on the notification bell to keep up to date. 

You will be notified via email about how to submit ([Register here](https://www.aka.ms/registermsa) for communcations) and like our [Facebook page](https://www.aka.ms/nzmsa) to stay up to date.

All the YouTube videos will have corresponding documentation on GitHub so "watch" the repository to find out immediately when we commit changes.
